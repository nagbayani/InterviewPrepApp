/** Rendering Tests:
 *    Test if DeckLink renders correctly with the given id, title, path, thumbnail, and description props.
 *    Test if DeckLink displays the deck title and description.
 *    Test if the DeckLink component applies the correct background style based on the thumbnail prop.
 */

/** Interaction Tests:
 *    Test that clicking on the title allows the user to edit it (mocking or simulating title edit mode).
 *    Test that pressing "Enter" or "Return" saves the edited title.
 *    Test that clicking outside the input field triggers the handleInputBlur function.
 *    Test that the DeckLinkMenu dropdown works as expected and triggers the appropriate actions (like deleting a deck).
 */

/** State and API Interaction Tests:
 *    Mock the API requests for updating and deleting a deck to ensure that the updateDeck and deleteDeck functions are called appropriately.
 *    Test error handling when the API requests fail (e.g., show an error message and revert changes).
